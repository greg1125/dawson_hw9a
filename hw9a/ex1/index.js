    <p>
        (a) The output is [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]. <br>

        (b) The output is [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]. <br> 
        
        (c) The outputs differ because in (a) you filter first (keeping only even numbers) and then double them, <br>
        while in (b) you double all numbers first (making them all even) and then filter, so you end up keeping every number. <br>
